# Output Pointer Parameters

Have you ever wanted to pass a smart pointer like `std::unique_ptr` or `boost::shared_ptr` or `boost::intrusive_ptr` to a C API?

```
boost::shared_ptr<mll_driver> axis_driver;
mll_errno err = mll_driver_init(&axis_driver, 
	PWM_AXIS_ZERO, 
	VLT_LOW_POW | VLT_POW_SAVE,
	0x001B);
if (err != MLL_SUCESS) {
	// ...
}
```

The above code doesn't compile: the pointer may be "smart", but it isn't smart enough to return a `mll_driver**` when you do `&axis_driver` on it. It also makes it hard to retain the current deleter with a `shared_ptr`. Downgrading to a raw pointer and then inserting it into the pointer works, but is more verbose:

```
boost::shared_ptr<mll_driver> axis_driver;
mll_driver* raw_axis_driver = nullptr;
mll_errno err = mll_driver_init(&raw_axis_driver, 
	PWM_AXIS_ZERO, 
	VLT_LOW_POW | VLT_POW_SAVE,
	0x001B);
if (err != MLL_SUCESS) {
	// ...
}
axis_driver.reset(raw_axis_driver, mll_driver_free);
```

This works, but you need to call `.reset(...)` with the raw pointer and set everything up. Plus, there could be a lot of error handling code between us and the actual initialization call. Not to mention a thrown exception between the end of that call and `axis_driver.reset(...);` means you may have a leak.

With `boost.out_ptr`, we can do better. Get rid of the raw pointer and avoid potential memory or resource leakage by using this https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii[RAII] function:

```
boost::shared_ptr<mll_driver> axis_driver(nullptr);
mll_errno err = mll_driver_init(boost::ptr::out_ptr(axis_driver, mll_driver_free), 
	PWM_AXIS_ZERO, 
	VLT_LOW_POW | VLT_POW_SAVE,
	0x001B);
if (err != MLL_SUCESS) {
	// ...
}
```

No reset call, no inspecting for exception safety, and it remembers the deleter we passed in after `axis_driver` to safely and properly call `.reset()`.
