# Rationale

Below is the rationale for the design. Most of this rationale can also be found in https://thephd.github.io/vendor/future_cxx/papers/d1132.html[p1132 - std::out_ptr].


## Why not a CTAD-based design?

A design where the class itself is called `out_ptr` and CTAD is relied on means that the casting version of the factory function -- `boost::out_ptr::out_ptr<IUnknown>(my_derived_smart_ptr);` -- would not work. It means that you would need to write a second version, `boost::out_ptr::out_ptr_cast<IUnknown>(my_derived_smart_ptr)`. This does not improve the interface at all: you need to remember 2 functions. It also means you could never supply template arguments to `boost::out_ptr::out_ptr(my_derived_smart_ptr)`. We believe the factory function is a superior design, and works further back than just C++17.


## Move Constructible? Move Assignable?!

The class is move constructible to enable it to be properly returned and placed as an argument into functions that take things by values. You can imagine a wrapper for a C API that takes all arguments by value and drops them into the real function call.

This is also C++11, where copy elision is not guaranteed. In a C++17 library, the move constructor may be less likely. The move assignment comes along for the ride because a type that is move constructible but not move assignable is not properly sussed out in the Standard or in Boost. There is still ongoing work on "what is a parameter-only type meant to look like and how much does it interplay with the rest of the C++ ecosystem"; we leave the final determination on the question to the pundits.

There is little harm in having it move assignable at the moment, and the semantics for such are well-defined. Individuals who write the specification for the C++ Standard have also expressed an interest in leaving it move assignable.


## `const` conversion `operator`?

The conversion operator is `const` to accommodate old code that takes parameters by `const T&`. This was the default for a lot of C++03 code, and it will be hard to justify breaking the users who wrote those wrappers (especially for C-like types going into C APIs, which by definition are value-based types and therefore do not care about wrapper functions that take things by `const T&` for efficiency).

We observe that the usage of `const_cast` here to enable returning a plain `Pointer*` rather than a `Pointer const*` does not trigger Undefined Behavior due to how it is read and used by the underlying function. This means that while the implementation must use a `const_cast` in order to return the `Pointer*`, it is still a safe `const_cast`.


## Wait a second -- this works with raw pointers?

Yes. The primary motivation behind this is due to generic wrapper functions. Passing in a raw pointer should simply be identical to using the `&ptr`: doing something different and making certain function calls explode and break for users does not seem like a valuable trade off for something that can be supported for essentially free.
